# EMBR
Enhanced Multimodal Bias Retrieval (EMBR) gives users access to unbiased information. By extracting information from multiple sources, our AI determines whether some news is accurate and combines it with other sources to remove bias. The users will only need to input the link, and our AI will handle everything else.

EMBR is presented to you by:
- Goh Zhen Rong @ZRG004
- Tristan Amadeus Surya @trisdeus

EMBR is a hackathon project for Deep Learning Week 2025, organized by MLDA@EEE.
